	<h2>About the Website</h2>
	<div class="box_text">
		"man math" provides a tool for the everyday person who is looking to learn, review, or see detailed examples of various mathematical subjects.
		In order to appeal to the novice, the ordering on the menus provides an order to follow from top to bottom that can be typically found in a given
		textbook. Each subject contains different topics, each topic contains different sections, and each section has notes and examples associated to it.
		The notes house a way to provide exactly what the section is about, sometimes with formal proofs and even explanations for the purpose of the mathematics
		at hand, while the examples provide concrete cases for the user to see the theory at work. The progression in examples typically increases with difficulty,
		thus providing a well balanced collection of different cases typically associated to the section. The goal in mind when using "man math" is to be able to
		use the website and close it either having gained some new knowledge or having cleared up a misunderstanding beforehand.

	<h2>About the Name</h2>
	<div class="box_text">
		The average person may not be a linux user since it is not user friendly and has a rather steep learning curve. The inspiration behind "man math" draws
		from the command line prompt known as "man" on linux. It is a shorthand for "manual" and is typically used to open the manual to some package. In this
		case, the package happens to be "math" which provides a mathematical library full of notes and examples on different sections.
