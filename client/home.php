		Welcome to man math. This is a personal project that I have been working on in order to bring a
		simplified experience of mathematics to students. I got my motivation throughout my undergraduate years as I found that professors
		can over complicate even the simplest topics so much that it may leave a student completely uninterested
		to learn that particular topic again. To avoid this, with this website I hope to explain various areas of mathematics
		with an intuitive approach. All the notes and examples provided are all written by myself. Currently I would this
		say this build of the website is in its alpha stage still, so I ask that if you find issues in either the functionality
		of the website or the notes provided, please email me to let know. I will even warn ahead of time that I did not even touch
		the mobile end of the website yet, so as far as mobile goes...hold off on viewing this on any small sized screen. At the current moment
		building the desktop version takes priority.
