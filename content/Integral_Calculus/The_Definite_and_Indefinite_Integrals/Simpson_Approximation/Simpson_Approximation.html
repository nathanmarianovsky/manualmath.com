	Simpson's Approximation
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	The approximations mentioned beforehand have all been based
	on the idea of linear polynomials. Specifically notice that
	rectangles are used one way or another in the left, right,
	trapezoidal, and midpoint approximations. One would hope 
	there must be a way of approximating with something other than rectangles,
	and it so happens there is and it is known as Simpson's Approximation.
	By using quadratic polynomials to approximate:

	Simpson's Rule states that the area under the curve is:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\textbf{Area}_{S}(2n) &= \frac{1}{6} \Big( y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + \dots + 4y_{2n-1} + y_{2n} \Big) \Delta x \\
			&= \frac{1}{6} \Big( y_0 + 4\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} y_{2i+1} + 2\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} y_{2i} + y_{2n} \Big) \Delta x
		}$

	where $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

	Deriving Simpson's Approximation
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	It is usually interesting to see how quadratic polynomials
	can be used to approximate an area. To start off, consider this
	scenario:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		<img src="/content/Integral_Calculus/The_Definite_and_Indefinite_Integrals/Simpson_Approximation/Deriving_Simpson_Approximation.png">
	</div>
	where we want to find the area on the range $[-h,h]$. At the same
	time notice the structure of how $\Delta x = h$ which implies
	that there are two "rectangles" being used to approximate this. It is 
	actually because of this that only an even number of partitions can
	be used for Simpson's approximation. So first to find the exact area:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\textbf{Area} &= \int_{-h}^h (ax^2 + bx + c) dx \\
			&= a \int_{-h}^h x^2 + b \int_{-h}^h x + c \int_{-h}^h dx \\
			&= 2a \int_0^h x^2 + 2c \int_0^h dx \\
			&= \Big( \frac{2}{3}ax^3 + 2cx \Big) \Big|_0^h \\
			&= \frac{2}{3}ah^3 + 2ch \\
			&= \frac{h}{3} \Big( 2ah^2 + 6c \Big)
		}$
	</div>
	Before moving on with the exact area, consider that the above setup
	has exactly three points attached to it. For each of these points:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y_0 &= ah^2 - bh + c \\
			y_1 &= c \\
			y_2 &= ah^2 + bh + C
		}$
	</div>
	In other words:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y_0 + 4y_1 + y_2 = 2ah^2 + 6c
		}$
	</div>
	So now the exact area can be defined as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\textbf{Area} &= \frac{h}{3} \Big( y_0 + 4y_1 + y_2 \Big) \\
			&= \frac{\Delta x}{3} \Big( y_0 + 4y_1 + y_2 \Big)
		}$
	</div>
	Now to extend this consider the fact that this original setup had only
	three points. What if the region has more points? So on every set of three
	points we can setup the area as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\textbf{Area}_S(n) &= \frac{\Delta x}{3} \Big( y_0 + 4y_1 + y_2 \Big) + \frac{\Delta x}{3} \Big( y_2 + 4y_3 + y_4 \Big) + \dots + \frac{\Delta x}{3} \Big( y_{n-2} + 4y_{n-1} + y_n \Big) \\
			&= \frac{1}{3} \Big( y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + \dots + 4y_{n-1} + y_n \Big) \Delta x
		}$
	</div>
	Now since $n$ has to be an even number, we can rewrite the definition as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\textbf{Area}_S(2n) &= \frac{1}{3} \Big( y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + \dots + 4y_{2n-1} + y_{2n} \Big) \Delta x' \\
			&= \frac{1}{3} \Big( y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + \dots + 4y_{2n-1} + y_{2n} \Big) \frac{x_{2n}-x_0}{2n} \\
			&= \frac{1}{6} \Big( y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + \dots + 4y_{2n-1} + y_{2n} \Big) \frac{x_{2n}-x_0}{n} \\
			&= \frac{1}{6} \Big( y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + \dots + 4y_{2n-1} + y_{2n} \Big) \Delta x
		}$
	</div>
	where
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\Delta x' = \frac{x_{2n}-x_0}{2n}
		}$
	</div>
	is the new width that is to be used with $2n$ subdivisions. Fortunately, the formula above was put into a form where
	the original width is used in order to not worry about the width changing.

	Simpson's Approximation as a Weighted Average
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Using some algebraic manipulation it can be shown that Simpson's
	approximation is just a weighted average of the midpoint and
	trapezoidal approximations:

			&= \frac{1}{3} \Big( y_0 + 2y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + \dots + 2y_{2n-1} + y_{2n} \Big) \Delta x' + \frac{1}{3} \Big( y_1 + y_3 + y_5 + \dots + y_{2n-1} \Big) \Delta x \\
			&= \frac{1}{3} \Big( 2\textbf{Area}_T(2n) \Big) + \frac{1}{3} \Big( \textbf{Area}_M(n) \Big) \\
			&= \frac{1}{3} \Big( \textbf{Area}_T(n) + \textbf{Area}_M(n) \Big) + \frac{1}{3} \textbf{Area}_M(n) \\
			&= \frac{1}{3} \textbf{Area}_T(n) + \frac{2}{3} \textbf{Area}_M(n)

	Seeing as how Simpson's approximation can be written as a weighted average
	of both the midpoint and trapezoid approximations, it should be obvious that
	it lies between the two approximations. To see this consider the two possible cases.
