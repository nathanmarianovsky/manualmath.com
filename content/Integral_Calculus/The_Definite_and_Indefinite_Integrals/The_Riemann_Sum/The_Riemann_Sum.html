	The Exact Area Under a Curve
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Finally after discussing five different approximations,
	in this section it will shown how the exact area under a 
	curve is computed. For starters let:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\int_a^b f(x) dx
		}$
	</div>
	represent the exact area under the curve $f(x)$ on the range
	$[a,b]$. To compute this $\textit{definite integral}$, the Riemann
	Sum is defined either through the right approximation:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\int_a^b f(x) dx &= \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x \\
			&= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{b-a}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)
		}$
	</div>
	or the left approximation:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\int_a^b f(x) dx &= \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(x_i) \Delta x \\
			&= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{b-a}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(x_i)
		}$
	</div>
	and
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}
		}$
	</div>
	is defined as the constant width. The reason why either the left or right approximation can be used
	with an infinite number of subdivisions can be found in the section relating to these approximations.
	Though essentially it is because as an infinite number of subdivisions are taken, both approximations
	will approach the exact value. With this we say:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\int_a^b f(x) dx \hspace{.5cm} \text{exists iff} \hspace{.5cm} \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{b-a}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{b-a}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(x_i)
		}$
	</div>
	It is exactly for this setup that we chose
	a constant width for the approximations since all approximations are of the form
	of a Riemann Sum. This setup serves as the general definition of the Riemann Integral,
	but certainly has a downside. Computing by hand can be done for some examples, but problems
	can become impossible very quickly.

	Properties of Sums & Useful Identities

<div class="latex_body">
	For examples relating to this section you will need to
	know the following properties of sums which make it a linear
	operator:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\sum_i \Big( a_i + b_i \Big) &= \sum_i a_i + \sum_i b_i \\
			\sum_i \lambda a_i &= \lambda \sum_i a_i \hspace{.5cm} \text{where} \hspace{.3cm} \lambda \in \mathbb{R}
		}$
	</div>
	and the following identities for computation:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\sum_{i=0}^n i &= \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\
			\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 &= \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \\
			\sum_{i=0}^n i^3 &= \Big( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \Big)^2
