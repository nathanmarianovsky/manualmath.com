	The Area Under a Curve
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	The study of integral calculus mainly starts with wanting to find
	the area under any arbitrary curve that is bounded and continous.
	But before introducing how exact area is computed, consider the use of
	approximations. For any given approximation, we can either be a little
	over or under the exact value. So with this notion we can introduce
	the ideas of underestimates and overestimates. Given any curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$,
	the area under the curve on the range $[a,b]$ can be approximated by using rectangles
	such as below:

<div class="latex_section">
	Left and Right Approximations
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	In the scope of undegraduate integral calculus classes, the functions of interest
	are usually stricted to being $\textit{monotonic}$ functions. This means that
	the function is either strictly increasing or decreasing on the interval of interest,
	$[a,b]$. Due to this, the underestimate and overestimate of the area under the curve
	can be approximated simply as the left and right approximations. Assume that the above
	picture of $f(x)$ has $n$ partitions instead of six. With a setup of $n$ partitions,
	the table of values for the function on the interval for all $n+1$ points becomes:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		<table>
	    	<tr>
		    	<td>$\textbf{x}$</td>
			    <td>$x_0 = a$</td>
			    <td>$x_1$</td>
			    <td>$x_2$</td>
			    <td>$x_3$</td>
			    <td>$\dots$</td> 
			    <td>$x_n = b$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>$\textbf{f(x)}$</td>
			    <td>$f(x_0)$</td>
			    <td>$f(x_1)$</td>
			    <td>$f(x_2)$</td>
			    <td>$f(x_3)$</td>
			    <td>$\dots$</td>
			    <td>$f(x_n)$</td> 
		    </tr>
		</table>
	</div>
	For each rectangle the height is represented as the function evaluated at the point and
	the width is going to be defined as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}
		}$
	</div>
	so that the width stays consistant for each rectangle. There is no reason right now why
	we choose to have a constant width, but it certainly helps ease the calculations. So to find the area
	under the curve we just have to sum up the areas of the rectangles, but notice in the picture above that
	for each rectangle there are two points associated to it. One point is the left endpoint and the other 
	the right endpoint. For the left approximation we will always choose the left points and for the right
	approximation the right endpoints. So to be formal:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\textbf{Area}_L(n) &= \sum_{i=0}^{n} f(x_i) \Delta x \\
			\textbf{Area}_R(n) &= \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} f(x_i) \Delta x
		}$
	</div>
	You can imagine that the more partitions that are used, the more accurate the answer is. To see this
	more clearly, observe the difference in the approximations:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\Big| \textbf{Area}_R(n) - \textbf{Area}_L(n) \Big| &= \Big| \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} f(x_i) \Delta x - \sum_{i=0}^n f(x_i) \Delta x \Big| \\
			&= \Big| f(x_{n+1}) \Delta x + \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x - f(x_0) \Delta x - \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x \Big| \\
			&= \Big| f(x_{n+1}) \Delta x - f(x_0) \Delta x \Big| \\
			&= \Big| f(x_{n+1}) - f(x_0) \Big| \Delta x
		}$
	</div>
	Now take a limit:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \Big| \textbf{Area}_R(n) - \textbf{Area}_L(n) \Big| &= \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \Big| f(x_{n+1}) - f(x_0) \Big| \Delta x = 0
		}$
	</div>
	This limit implies that the left and right approximations are equalivalent. So the only thing left to figure out is when does
	$\Delta x \rightarrow 0$? Observe that:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \Delta x = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{b - a}{n} = 0
		}$
	</div>
	So as an infinite number of partitions are taken, the exact area is calculated and is equivalent to both
	the left and right approximations simultaneously.

	Comparison of Approximations
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Given any arbitrary function whose area we want to find on a range
	$[a,b]$, how do we tell which approximation is an overestimate and which
	is an underestimate? The very fact that we already restricted these approximations
	to monotonic functions gives a clue. If the function is increasing, then $f(x_n) \geq f(x_0)$
	which shows the difference in areas is positive above and the right approximation is an overestimate.
	On the other hand if the function is decreasing, $f(x_0) \geq f(x_n)$ which implies
	the difference above will be negative meaning that the left approximation is an overestimate. If one
	is an overestimate, then obviously the other must be an underestimate since the exact area is always
	between the two.
