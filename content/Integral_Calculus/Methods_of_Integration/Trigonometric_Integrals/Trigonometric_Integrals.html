	A Reminder of Useful Trigonometric Identities
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	Trigonometric identities come in very useful towards some
	integrals involving trigonometric functions. So as a fresh reminder
	we start with the Pythagorean Identities:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) &= 1 \\
			\tan^2(x) + 1 &= \sec^2(x) \\
			1 + \cot^2(x) &= \csc^2(x)
		}$
	</div>
	Double-Angle Identities:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\sin(2x) &= 2\sin(x)\cos(x) \\
			\cos(2x) &= \cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x) \\
			&= 2\cos^2(x) - 1 \\
			&= 1 - 2\sin^2(x)
		}$
	</div>
	and Product-to-Sum Identities:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\sin(x)\sin(y) &= \frac{1}{2} \Big( \cos(x-y) - \cos(x+y) \Big) \\
			\cos(x)\cos(y) &= \frac{1}{2} \Big( \cos(x-y) + \cos(x+y) \Big) \\
			\sin(x)\cos(y) &= \frac{1}{2} \Big( \sin(x+y) + \sin(x-y) \Big)
		}$
	</div>
	Of course besides these sets there are far more, but I have found that a lot of examples
	will usually rely on these identities.

	Trigonometric Integrals
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	Trigonometric integrals are nothing more than a title given to integrals
	whose integrand contains some trigonometric function. These integrals come in many forms,
	but the general tactic is to choose the correct identities such that the integration simplifies.
	Double-Angle Identities for example can reduce down a $\sin$ or $\cos$ that is squared to a single
	power. Product-to-Sum Identities are especially useful since integrals can be broken down under
	addition. Unfortunately, for these types of integrals there are no hints since examples can vary
	on a wide range. All that can be said is think of what identities can be used.
