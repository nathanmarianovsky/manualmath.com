	Definition for Indefinite Integral
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	Given an integral in the form of:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\int f(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) dx
		}$
	</div>
	where a prime denotes the first derivative, the approach
	to simplify the integration is to let $u = g(x)$ and $du = g'(x) dx$
	such that:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\int f(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) dx = \int f(u) du
		}$
	</div>
	When writing down the final answer remember to convert back using $u = g(x)$.

	Definition for Definite Integral
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	Given an integral in the form of:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\int_a^b f(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) dx
		}$
	</div>
	where a prime denotes the first derivative, the approach
	to simplify the integration is to let $u = g(x)$ and $du = g'(x) dx$
	exactly the same as for the indefinite integral. The first difference
	with the definite integral is that the boundaries also have to be
	redefined such that:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\int_a^b f(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) dx = \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u) du
		}$
	</div>
	The second difference with the indefinite integral is that there is no need to 
	substitute back since the final answer is always going to be a scalar no
	matter the substitution.
