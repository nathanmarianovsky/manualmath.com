	Type I Improper Integrals
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	When the word improper is attached to an integral,
	it refers to the fact that somewhere along the range
	of integration there is an issue. Type I improper integrals
	refer to the obstruction of having an infinity in the boundary
	of integration. To handle the case of an infinity, just use a limit
	to rewrite the integral and evaluate same as always:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\int_a^\infty f(x) dx &= \lim_{b \rightarrow \infty} \int_a^b f(x) dx \\
			\int_{-\infty}^b f(x) dx &= \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \int_{-a}^b f(x) dx \\
			\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) dx &= \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \int_{-a}^b f(x) dx + \lim_{c \rightarrow \infty} \int_b^c f(x) dx
		}$

	Type II Improper Integrals
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Type II improper integrals handle the case of the
	integrand becoming undefined somewhere along the range of
	integration. For example, consider that the range is
	$[a,b]$ and $c \in [a,b]$ is the point at which $f(c) = \infty$. Obviously
	this is an issue since the Riemann Integral requires that a function
	be not only bounded but also continous. So to handle the integration,
	write limits and split up where necessary:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\int_a^c f(x) dx &= \lim_{k \rightarrow c^-} \int_a^k f(x) dx \\
			\int_c^b f(x) dx &= \lim_{k \rightarrow c^+} \int_k^b f(x) dx \\
			\int_a^b f(x) dx &= \lim_{m \rightarrow c^-} \int_a^m f(x) dx + \lim_{n \rightarrow c^+} \int_n^b f(x) dx
		}$

<div class="latex_body">
	In cases of improper integrals, both types, an integral can have two results.
	An integral can either achieve a finite value after the limit evaluation, or
	go to infinity. In the case where the result is finite, the integral is said to 
	$\textit{converge}$. Otherwise the integral $\textit{diverges}$.
