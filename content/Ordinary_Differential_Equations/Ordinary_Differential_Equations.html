		Across many fields of science, relationships between various variables call for the need of
		incorporating various derivatives in order to write down equations relating the variables. Ordinary differential equations are a class of equations that contain derivatives, but are restricted to functions of only a single independent variable. As an example take the equation for Newton's Second Law of Motion which governs all of Classical Mechanics:
		<div class="latex_equation">
			$\eqalign{
				F(r(t)) = m\frac{d^2}{dt^2}r(t)
			}$
		</div>
		where $F$ is the force, $m$ is the constant mass, and $r$ is the displacement function. Even this simple equation is a differential equation at heart. While there exist many different differential equations out there, each can be characterized by its order, homogeneous behavior, and linear behavior. Typically cases of interest include studying special first-order, second-order, and $n$th-order equations that are known to have analytic solutions. As an extension systems of equations are also studied because they provide a rather systematic way of solving linear differential equations. Overall the study of ordinary differential equations lays the groundwork for how partial differential equations are approached where partial refers to the fact that the functions involved may have more than a single independent variable.
