		Moving beyond first order differential equations lands you right at second order equations. Equations of this degree and higher generally do not have as many special cases as the first order, but nonetheless the couple that are going to be mentioned arise commonly enough to make them worth mentioning. Constant coefficient and linear second order differential equations are typically the first studied since they have a very clear understanding from a linear algebra perspective and the solutions are typically determined by the behavior of the characteristic polynomial for a given equation. Next up is the Cauchy-Euler differential equation that surprisingly is deeply related to the constant coefficient linear equation whose behavior is already known. To wrap up second order linear differential equations, variation of parameters is introduced as a general method to solve the non-homogeneous version of the equations here. As an extension laplace transformations and power series solutions will provide different approaches to solving more general cases.
