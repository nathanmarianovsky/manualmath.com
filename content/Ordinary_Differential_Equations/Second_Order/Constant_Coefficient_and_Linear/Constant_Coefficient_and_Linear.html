	Given a linear constant coefficient second order differential equation: 
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y'' + ay' + by = 0
		}$
	</div>
	where:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			a,b \in \mathbb{R}
		}$
	</div>
	suppose that the solution takes on the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y(x) = e^{mx} \hspace{.5cm} \text{where} \hspace{.5cm} m \in \mathbb{R}
		}$
	</div>
	and plug into the differential equation:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			0 &= y'' + ay' + by \\
			0 &= m^2e^{mx} + ame^{mx} + be^{mx} \\
			0 &= e^{mx}(m^2 + am + b) \\
			0 &= m^2 + am + b
		}$
	</div>
	to arrive at what is known as the $\textit{characterisitc polynomial}$. Now depending upon the values that $m$ takes on, the solution takes on different forms. So to isolate $m$, use the quadratic formula:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			m = \frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}
		}$
	</div>

	Two Real Roots
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Lets assume that the discriminant is strictly positive:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			a^2 - 4b > 0
		}$
	</div>
	With this we know that there are going to be two real values that $m$ can take on. So using the principle of superposition for homogeneous differential equations the general solution will take on the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y(x) = c_1e^{m_1x} + c_2e^{m_2x} 
		}$
	</div>

	Repeated Root
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Lets assume that the discriminant is zero now:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			a^2 - 4b = 0
		}$
	</div>
	With this we know that there is going to be one real value that $m$ can take on. So lets use reduction of order to obtain the second solution with the setup:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y_2 &= ve^{mx} \\
			y_2' &= v'e^{mx} + mve^{mx} \\
			y_2'' &= v''e^{mx} + 2mv'e^{mx} + m^2ve^{mx}
		}$
	</div>
	Plugging this in gives:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			0 &= y_2'' + ay_2' + by_2 \\
			0 &= (v''e^{mx} + 2mv'e^{mx} + m^2ve^{mx}) + a(v'e^{mx} + mve^{mx}) + bve^{mx} \\
			0 &= e^{mx}\Big[ v'' + v'(2m + a) + v(y_1'' + ay_1' + by_1) \Big] \\
			0 &= v'' + v'(2m + a)
		}$
	</div>
	Now make the substitution:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			w = v'
		}$
	</div>
	and continue:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			0 &= v'' + v'(2m + a) \\
			0 &= w' + w(2m + a) \\
			\frac{dw}{dx} &= -w(2m + a) \\
		}$
	</div>
	Now use the fact that the discriminant is zero which implies $m = -\frac{a}{2}$ and that $2m + a = 0$:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{dw}{dx} &= 0 \\
			w &= D_1
		}$
	</div>
	Using this to solve for $v$:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			v' &= w \\
			\frac{dv}{dx} &= D_1 \\
			\int dv &= D_1\int dx \\
			v &= D_1x + D_2
		}$
	</div>
	With this the second solution takes on the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y_2(x) = xe^{mx}
		}$
	</div>
	which means that the general solution is written down as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y(x) = c_1e^{mx} + c_2xe^{mx}
		}$
	</div>
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Two Imaginary Roots
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Lets assume that the discriminant is strictly negative:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			a^2 - 4b < 0
		}$
	</div>
	With this we know that there are going to be two imaginary values that $m$ can take on. So using the principle of superposition for homogeneous differential equations the general solution will take on the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y(x) = c_1e^{m_1x} + c_2e^{m_2x} 
		}$
	</div>
	where:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			m_1,m_2 \in \mathbb{C} 
		}$
	</div>
	Unfortunately nobody likes having imaginary exponentials therefore lets make use of Euler's Formula:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			e^{iz} = \cos(z) + i\sin(z) \hspace{.5cm} \text{where} \hspace{.5cm} z \in \mathbb{C}
		}$
	</div>
	Take the general solution and assume that the roots can be written as $m_1,m_2 = \alpha \pm \beta i$:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y(x) &= c_1e^{m_1x} + c_2e^{m_2x} \\
			&= c_1e^{(\alpha + \beta i)x} + c_2e^{(\alpha - \beta i)x} \\
			&= e^{\alpha x} (c_1e^{i(\beta x)} + c_2e^{i(-\beta x)}) \\
			&= e^{\alpha x} \Big[ c_1(\cos(\beta x) + i\sin(\beta x)) + c_2(\cos(-\beta x) + i\sin(-\beta x)) \Big] \\
			&= e^{\alpha x} \Big[ (c_1 + c_2)\cos(\beta x) + (c_1i - c_2i)\sin(\beta x) \Big] \\
			&= e^{\alpha x} \Big[ k_1\cos(\beta x) + k_2\sin(\beta x) \Big] \\
		}$
	</div>
	where:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			k_1 = c_1 + c_2 \hspace{.5cm} \text{and} \hspace{.5cm} k_2 = i(c_1 - c_2)

	Motivating the Guess for the Solution
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	When deriving the characteristic polynomial we assumed that the solution took on a particular form, but you have to wonder why specifically the exponential function and not some other function. To explain this I am going to make use of a particular operator and its associated eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. Take the derivative operator and setup the following relationship:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \lambda f(x)
		}$
	</div>
	where $f(x)$ and $\lambda$ are known as the $\textit{eigenfunction}$ and $\textit{eigenvalue}$ respectively associated to the derivative operator. Now using techniques from first order separable differential equations the eigenfunction takes on the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{df}{dx} &= \lambda f \\
			\frac{df}{f} &= \lambda dx \\
			\int \frac{df}{f} &= \int \lambda dx \\
			\ln|f| &= \lambda x \\
			f(x) &= e^{\lambda x}
		}$
	</div>
	where the constant of integration is ignored since by definition and multiple of an eigenfunction is also an eigenfunction. So now we have the eigenfunction and eigenvalue to the derivative operator, using this take the differential equation and rewrite it:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			0 &= y'' + ay' + by \\
			&= \frac{d^2}{dx^2}y + a\frac{d}{dx}y + by \\
			&= \frac{d}{dx}\Big( \frac{d}{dx}y \Big) + a\frac{d}{dx}y + by \\
			&= \frac{d}{dx} (\lambda y) + a(\lambda y) + by \\
			&= \lambda\frac{d}{dx}y + a\lambda y + by \\
			&= \lambda^2 y + a\lambda y + by \\
			&= (\lambda^2 + a\lambda + b)y \\
			&= \lambda^2 + a\lambda + b
		}$
	</div>
	which provides us with the characteristic polynomial. Now we know that the characterisitc polynomial actually provides us with the eigenvalues to our guess for the solution which is the associated eigenfunction.
