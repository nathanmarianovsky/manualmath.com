	A power series expansion of a function is defined as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n (x - x_0)^n
		}$
	</div>
	an infinite polynomial centered at $x = x_0$ where $a_n$ represents the coefficients. Now given that we have a region of convergence for this power series, then we can also talk about its derivatives:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f'(x) &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty n a_n (x - x_0)^{n - 1} \\
			f''(x) &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty n(n - 1)a_n (x - x_0)^{n - 2}
		}$

	Given a homogeneous linear second order differential equation:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			p(x)y'' + q(x)y' + r(x)y = 0
		}$
	</div>
	where $p(x)$, $q(x)$, and $r(x)$ are $\textit{analytic functions}$, can be locally expressed as a power series, then the solution can be determined in the form of a power series. The main task when using a power series as a solution becomes determining the coefficients. Typically the approach is to take all of the sums and to try to combine them under a single sum so that the equation becomes:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\sum_{n = 0}^\infty k(n) (x - x_0)^n = 0 
		}$
	</div>
	where $k(n)$ represents the function that will contain the coefficients and $n$. Now like a polynomial, the power series is only identically zero iff all of its coefficients are zero. So to determine the coefficients it becomes a task of solving:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			k(n) = 0
		}$
	</div>
	which can sometimes provide an explicit form for all of the coefficients or just be left as a recurrence relation with some initial condition(s).
