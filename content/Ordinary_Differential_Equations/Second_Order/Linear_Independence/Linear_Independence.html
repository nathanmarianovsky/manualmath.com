	Linear Independence of Functions
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	From linear algebra any two vectors are linearly dependent if $\exists \hspace{.1cm} c_1,c_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ s.t.:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\overrightarrow{0} = c_1\overrightarrow{v}_1 + c_2\overrightarrow{v}_2
		}$
	</div>
	Otherwise, if the trivial solution $c_1 = c_2 = 0$ is the only solution the vectors are linearly independent. Similarly any two functions are said to be $\textit{linearly dependent}$ if $\exists \hspace{.1cm} c_1,c_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ s.t.:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			0 = c_1y_1(x) + c_2y_2(x)
		}$
	</div>
	Otherwise, if the trivial solution $c_1 = c_2 = 0$ is the only solution the functions are $\textit{linearly independent}$.
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	The Wronskian
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Now given the relation for determining the dependence of two functions, same as above, we can go on to say:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{d}{dx}(0) &= \frac{d}{dx}(c_1y_1(x) + c_2y_2(x)) \\
			0 &= c_1y_1'(x) + c_2y_2'(x)
		}$
	</div>
	iff $y_1,y_2 \in C^1$ which means that the functions have continuous first derivatives. Now putting these two equations together gives:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			0 &= c_1y_1(x) + c_2y_2(x) \\
			0 &= c_1y_1'(x) + c_2y_2'(x)
		}$
	</div>
	which can be rewritten in matrix form as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\begin{pmatrix}
				0 \\
				0
			\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
				y_1 & y_2 \\
				y_1' & y_2'
			\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
				c_1 \\
				c_2
			\end{pmatrix}
		}$
	</div>
	and is guaranteed to have the trivial solution as the unique solution iff:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			0 &\neq \det \begin{pmatrix}
				y_1 & y_2 \\
				y_1' & y_2'
			\end{pmatrix} \\
			0 &\neq y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'
		}$
	</div>
	With the determinant non-zero, the matrix is guaranteed to have an inverse, and typically this determinant is referred to as the $\textit{Wronskian}$.

<div class="latex_section">
	Fundamental Set of Solutions
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Building off of independent solutions leads right to what is called the $\textit{fundamental set of solutions}$. Given a homogeneous linear second order equation:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y'' + p(x)y' + q(x) = 0
		}$
	</div>
	where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are known independent solutions, the fundamental set of solutions is formally defined as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\mathcal{S} = \{y_1, y_2\}
		}$
	</div>
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Abel's Identity
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	The Wronskian, while easy to determine with the definition above, has another form. Assume that we are given a homogeneous linear second order equation:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y'' + p(x)y' + q(x) &= 0 \\
			-(p(x)y' + q(x)y) &= y''
		}$
	</div>
	and its fundamental set of solutions:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\mathcal{S} = \{y_1, y_2\}
		}$
	</div>
	With this, the Wronskian is defined as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			W(y_1, y_2) = y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'
		}$
	</div>
	Now taking the derivative gives:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\require{cancel}
			W'(y_1, y_2) &= \frac{d}{dx}(y_1y_2' - y_2y_1') \\
			&= \cancel{y_1'y_2'} + y_1y_2'' - \cancel{y_2'y_1'} - y_2y_1'' \\
			&= y_1y_2'' - y_2y_1'' \\
			&= -y_1(p(x)y_2' + q(x)y_2) + y_2(p(x)y_1' + q(x)y_1) \\
			&= -p(x)(y_1y_2' - y_2y_1') \\
			&= -p(x)W(y_1, y_2)
		}$
	</div>
	where I used the differential equation to replace the second derivatives. Now we have a separable first order differential equation that can be solved to obtain the Wronskian:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{dW}{dx} &= -p(x)W \\
			\frac{dW}{W} &= -p(x) dx \\			
			\int \frac{dW}{W} &= \int -p(x) dx \\			
			\ln|W| &= P(x) + C \\
			W &= Ke^{P(x)}
		}$
	</div>
	where:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			P(x) = -\int p(x) dx \hspace{.5cm} \text{and} \hspace{.5cm} K = e^C
		}$
	</div>
	but the drawback here is that there is an unknown constant. So to make sense of this we have to talk about the fundamental solutions existing on some interval, $I \subset \mathbb{R}$. If we have an interval on which the solutions exist then we may choose any arbitrary point, $x_o \in I$, so that:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{	
			W(x) &= W(x_0) \int_{x_0}^x -p(t) dt \\
		}$
	</div>
	This is what is known as Abel's Identity which states that either the Wronskian is always going to be zero or non-zero $\forall x_0 \in I$.
