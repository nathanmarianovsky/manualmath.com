	where $k,k_1,k_2,\dots,k_n,\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ represent given constants, $p(x)$ is a $n$th degree polynomial, and $A,B,C,A_0,B_0,A_1,B_1,A_2,B_2,\dots,A_n,B_n \in \mathbb{R}$ represent the coefficients that have to be determined in order to write down the non-homogeneous solution. To find the coefficients, just plug into the non-homogeneous differential equation and determine their values. If it happens that $f(x)$ is actually a sum of different cases, just use the principal of non-homogeneous linear differential equations.

	Non-Homogeneous Guess is Part of Homogeneous Solution
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Sometimes it may happen that the guess for the non-homogeneous solution is already part of the homogeneous solution. Fortunately, there is a fix. Take the standard guess for the non-homogeneous solution and multiply it by $x$. This idea comes from the fact that when a root is repeated in a characteristic polynomial, we form another independent solution by multiplying by $x$. To build off this, there can actually be another case. If it happens that you have for example $y_1 = x$ and $f(x) = x^3$, you would normally guess a third degree polynomial. Unfortunately, it is not that easy. Since these both share a common root, or rather eigenvalue, we still have to guess a multiple of it, so the correct guess would be a fourth degree polynomial.
