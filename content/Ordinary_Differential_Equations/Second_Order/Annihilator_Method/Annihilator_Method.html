	During the constant coefficient and linear section I discussed the idea of the derivative as an operator. Fortunately this idea generalizes in a very nice fashion. It is common to write the derivative operator as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			D = \frac{d}{dx}
		}$
	</div>
	Using this we can take any linear second order differential equation and rewrite it as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			g(x) &= y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y \\
			&= D^2y + p(x)Dy + q(x)y \\
			&= (D^2 + p(x)D + q(x))y \\
			&= L(D)y
		}$
	</div>
	where:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			L(D) = D^2 + p(x)D + q(x)
		}$
	</div>
	is the differential equation operator. In this sense we can write that the differential equation is homogeneous iff the differential equation operator acting on our function equates to zero, otherwise it is non-homogeneous. As a last remark consider the behavior of the differential equation operator:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			L(D)(y_1 + y_2) &= D^2(y_1 + y_2) + p(x)D(y_1 + y_2) + q(x)(y_1 + y_2) \\
			&= (D^2y_1 + p(x)Dy_1 + q(x)y_1) + (D^2y_2 + p(x)Dy_2 + q(x)y_2) \\
			&= L(D)y_1 + L(D)y_2 \\
			L(D)(\lambda y) &= D^2(\lambda y) + p(x)D(\lambda y) + q(x)(\lambda y) \\
			&= \lambda(D^2y + p(x)Dy + q(x)y) \\
			&= \lambda L(D)y
		}$
	</div>
	which make it a linear operator.
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Defining and Using the Annihilator Operator
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	To begin, take the differential equation of interest and rewrite it using operators:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(x) &= y'' + ay' + by \\
			&= D^2y + aDy + by \\
			&= (D^2 + aD + b)y \\
			&= L(D)y
		}$
	</div>
	Now lets assume that we can define an $\textit{annihilator operator}$ that:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			A(D)f = 0
		}$
	</div>
	sends the non-homogeneous part to zero. If we have such a tool at our disposal, then take the differential equation and apply the annihilator operator:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(x) &= L(D)y \\
			A(D)f(x) &= A(D)L(D)y \\
			0 &= A(D)L(D)y
		}$
	</div>
	With this we once again form a linear homogeneous differential equation that can be solved by just solving the characteristic polynomial. Having it factored as above is actually the way you want to keep it since you are going to be solving for the roots anyways. Essentially all that has to be done is replace all of the $D$'s with $\lambda$'s and solve for the $\lambda$'s. This will provide us with a basis of solutions:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\mathcal{S} = \{ y_1,y_2,y_3,\dots,y_n \}
		}$
	</div>
	where the first two are to cover the homogeneous solution and the rest are to account for the annihilator operator. Now we form our general solution as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2 + c_3y_3 + \dots + c_ny_n
		}$
	</div>
	and apply our differential equation operator to both sides:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			L(D)y &= L(D)(c_1y_1 + c_2y_2 + c_3y_3 + \dots + c_ny_n) \\
			f(x) &= c_1L(D)y_1 + c_2L(D)y_2 + c_3L(D)y_3 + \dots + c_nL(D)y_n \\
			f(x) &= c_3L(D)y_3 + c_4L(D)y_4 + \dots + c_nL(D)y_n
		}$
	</div>
	where the differential equation operator is allowed to split under addition and pull out constants because it is a linear operator. Since I assumed that $y_1$ and $y_2$ are the solutions to the homogeneous differential equation, with the differential equation operator acting on them they will go to zero. Using the last line all of the coefficients have to be determined since the non-homogeneous solution cannot have undetermined constants.

	where $k,k_1,k_2,\alpha,\lambda,\omega \in \mathbb{R}$ are given constants and $p(x)$ with $q(x)$ are two polynomials of degree $n$, not necessarily different. Know that the general rule of hand if you have a sum of different cases is that the new annihilator is the multiplication of the different cases.
