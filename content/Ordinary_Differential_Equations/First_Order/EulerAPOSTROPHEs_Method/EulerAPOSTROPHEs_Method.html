	The Setup
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Given a differential equation in the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y' = f(x,y)
		}$
	</div>
	where $y'$ denotes the first derivative and $y(x_0) = y_0$, a simple approach known as $\textit{Euler's Method}$ serves as a numerical approximation to the first order differential equation with the recursive setup:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			x_{n + 1} &= x_n + h \\
			y_{n + 1} &\approx y_n + hf(x_n,y_n)
		}$
	</div>
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Deriving the Approximation
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	A simple approach to writing down Euler's Method can be attained from considering the formal definition of the derivative:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y'(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{y(x + h) - y(x)}{h}
		}$
	</div>
	and while this definition provides an exact solution because it allows the difference to become infinitesimally small, for numerical approximations we can just say:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y'(x) \approx \frac{y(x + h) - y(x)}{h}
		}$
	</div>
	if we assume that $h$ is small enough. Now reorganizing this:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y'(x) &\approx \frac{y(x + h) - y(x)}{h} \\
			hy'(x) &\approx y(x + h) - y(x) \\
			y(x + h) &\approx y(x) + hy'(x) \\
			y(x + h) &\approx y(x) + hf(x,y)
		}$
	</div>
	where the setup of the differential equation is used to replace the derivative. Now notice that we can discretize the system by letting:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			x_{n + 1} &= x_n + h \\
			y_{n + 1} &\approx y_n + hf(x_n,y_n)
		}$
	</div>
	where the starting point is given by the initial condition $y(x_0) = y_0$.
