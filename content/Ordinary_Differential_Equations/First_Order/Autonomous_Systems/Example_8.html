			Any function that does not have any equilibrium points is one whose slope does not change signs. For example consider the function:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					y(x) = e^x
				}$
			</div>
			which is known to always have a positive slope and is a constantly increasing function. Taking the derivative of both sides results in:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					y(x) &= e^x \\
					y'(x) &= \frac{d}{dx} e^x \\
					y'(x) &= e^x \\
					y'(x) &= y(x)
				}$
			</div>
			in an autonomous system that is known to not have any equilibrium points. So any function without equilibrium points is one that will either keep on increasing or decreasing depending upon the derivative.
