	The Setup
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	A differential equation in the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y'(x) = f(y(x))
		}$
	</div>
	is known as a first order autonomous system. It distinguishes itself from other first order differential equations because the derivative is only dependent on $y$ and not $x$.

	Equilibrium Points and the Phase Plot
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	When dealing with first order autonomous systems, $\textit{equilibrium points}$ are typically of interest. To be formal, any $y = y_0$ that satisfies:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(y_0) = 0
		}$
	</div>
	is known as an equilibrium point. After determining the equilibrium points we want to now observe how the derivative behaves on each of the intervals in between. For example take the autonomous system:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y'(x) = y(y + 1)(y - 1)^2
		}$
	</div>
	where the equilibrium points are $y = -1, 0, 1$. Now we want to determine the behavior of the function:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		<table>
	    	<tr>
		    	<td>Range</td>
			    <td>$y'(x)$ Behavior</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>$(-\infty,-1)$</td>
			    <td>+</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>$(-1,0)$</td>
			    <td>-</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>$(0,1)$</td>
			    <td>+</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>$(1,\infty)$</td>
			    <td>+</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>
	Plotting this out as a slope field gives what is known as the $\textit{phase plot}$:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		<img src="/content/Ordinary_Differential_Equations/First_Order/Autonomous_Systems/Autonomous_Example.png">
	</div>
	Now notice that each equilibrium point behaves a little differently. At $y = -1$ we have the vectors pointing towards from both below and above. Whenever this occurs the equilibrium point is said to be $\textit{stable}$. At $y = 0$ we have the vectors pointing away both below and above. Whenever this happens the equilibrium point is said to be $\textit{unstable}$. Lastly for $y = 1$ from below the vectors are pointing towards and above the vectors are pointing away, and so this halfway situation describes the equilibrium point as $\textit{semistable}$. Typically this type of information is enough to tell the behavior of a particular solution given the initial condition. For example consider that we have the initial condition $y(0) = -2$ for the differential equation above. What happens to $y(x)$ in the long run to the right:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} y(x) = ?
		}$
	</div>
	In order to make sense of this, plot the initial condition on the phase plot and notice that if we follow the pattern of the vectors it eventually lands us at $y = -1$. Sometimes books like to use what is known as a $\textit{phase line}$ which represents the behavior of the derivative on a one dimensional line instead of using a plot to show it. I will agree that the phase line provides enough information to work with, but the phase plot gives a better picture of what the family of curves will look like so I will stick to them instead.
