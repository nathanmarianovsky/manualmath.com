			Assuming that the autonomous system takes the form:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					y'(x) = f(y(x))
				}$
			</div>
			a translation in the independent variable would mean that a new solution would take on the form $y(x - k)$, which implies:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\frac{d}{dx} y(x - k) &= y'(x - k)
				}$
			</div>
			and so the new differential equation becomes:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					y'(x - k) = f(y(x - k))
				}$
			</div>
			which is not any different than the original one. Now if instead we are looking at a solution of the form $y(\alpha x)$, this implies:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\frac{d}{dx} y(\alpha x) &= \alpha y'(\alpha x)
				}$
			</div>
			and so the new differential equation becomes:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					y'(\alpha x) = \frac{1}{\alpha} f(y(\alpha x))
				}$
			</div>
