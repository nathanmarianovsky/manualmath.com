			First to obtain all the equilibrium points:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\frac{dy}{dx} &= 0 \\
					y - y\sin(y) &= 0 \\
					y(1 - \sin(y)) &= 0 \\
					y &= 0, \frac{\pi + 4k\pi}{2}
				}$
			</div>
			where:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					k \in \mathbb{Z}
				}$
			</div>
			Now to determine the behavior of the derivative consider the fact that the only thing contributing to the sign of the derivative is the $y$ outside since the rest is always positive. So whenever $y < 0$ the derivative is negative and for $y > 0$ it is positive. Using this to graph the phase plot:
			<div class="latex_equation">

			</div>
			For $y = 0$ the vectors below and above are pointing away, thus the equilibrium point is unstable. All other equilibrium points are semistable because one side will lean towards, while the other away since the direction is going to stay downwards for the region below $y = 0$ and upwards for the region above.
