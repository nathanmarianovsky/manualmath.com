	We know from experience that hot objects cool down to the temperature of their surroundings and cold objects warm up to the temperature of their surroundings. Newton's law of cooling says more specifically that the temperature difference between an object and its surroundings changes at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and that of its surroundings. Let $T(t)$ be the temperature of an object and $R(t)$ the temperature of the room in which it resides, where $t$ is measured in minutes since the object was placed in the room. Write a differential equation that models the temperature dynamics and identify its equilibrium point. After writing down the general differential equation suppose the temperature of the room is held constant at $65^\circ$ Celsius and a cup of hot mulled apple cider with a temperature of $180^\circ$ Celsius is placed in the room. What is the new differential equation?

			Given that the rate of change of the difference between $T(t)$ and $R(t)$ is proportional to the difference between $T(t)$ and $R(t)$:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\frac{d}{dt}(T - R) = k(T - R)
				}$
			</div>
			where the equilibrium point occurs at $T = R$. Now given the temperature of the room, the differential equation becomes:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\frac{d}{dt}(T - 65) = k(T - 65)
				}$
			</div>
			where $T(0) = 180$ is the initial condition.
