	The Setup
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	Given a differential equation in the form:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			M(x,y) dx + N(x,y) dy = 0
		}$
	</div>
	the method used to obtain the solution is analogous to finding the potential function
	to a conservative vector field.

	Motivating the Approach
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	Before mentioning the differential equation again, I first need to mention $\textit{Schwarz's Theorem}$
	(or $\textit{Clairaut's Theorem}$) which states that when given a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, then:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \Bigg|_P = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_j \partial x_i} \Bigg|_P 
			\hspace{.5cm} \forall i,j \in \{1,2,\dots,n\}
		}$
	</div>
	This is essentially a formal way of saying that second partial derivatives commute for any two variables. This will lay the groundwork
	for how the differential equation is handled.

<div class='latex_section'>
	Solving the Equation
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	To understand the approach in full detail I need to first explain the differential of a function. Given any function $F(x,y)$, the differential
	of the function is defined as:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			dF = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} dy
		}$
	</div>
	which is basically a way to measure how the overall function changes with respect to changes in the variables. Notice right away that this 
	differential pretty much matches the differential equation we want to solve. So now playing the matching game gives:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} &= M(x,y) \\
			\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} &= N(x,y) \\
			dF &= 0
		}$
	</div>
	The first two can easily be understood, but how do we interpret the last statement? If the differential of a function is defined to be zero,
	then it is essentially the same as saying that over the course of some curve, the function remains unchanged. This of course only happens when 
	a function is constant. Another question you may want to now ask is how do we know that this approach can be used to obtain a solution? In vector
	calculus a differential equating to zero is the same as saying that the function represents a conservative vector field and it happens that there is a condition
	which will guarantee a solution:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}
		}$
	</div>
	which is the same as stating:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial x \partial y} &= \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial y \partial x}
		}$
	</div>
	which has to hold true given that the function is twice differentiable. So now to solve the differential equation we are left with two equations to handle. 
	The first of which is: 
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} &= M(x,y) \\
			\frac{dF}{dx} &= M(x,y) \\
			dF &= M(x,y) dx \\
			\int dF &= \int M(x,y) dx \\
			F(x,y) &= f(x,y) + h(x)
		}$
	</div>
	and the second:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} &= N(x,y) \\
			\frac{dF}{dy} &= N(x,y) \\
			dF &= N(x,y) dy \\
			\int dF &= \int N(x,y) dy \\
			F(x,y) &= f(x,y) + g(y)
		}$
	</div>
	Notice that both integrations will spit out stuff that is common but also stuff that is independent. Formally the final solution is given as:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			C = f(x,y) + h(x) + g(x)
		}$
	</div>
	where the $C$ handles the constants of integration that should have come out of the integration above.
