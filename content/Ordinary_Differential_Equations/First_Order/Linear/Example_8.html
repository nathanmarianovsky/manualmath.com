	is a solution to the first order linear differential equation where $y(x_0) = y_0$ and $\mu(x)$ is the integrating factor by differentiating both sides. What is the difference between this solution and the one found in the notes?

			To take the derivative of both sides use the product rule:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					y'(x) &= \frac{d}{dx} \Big[ \frac{1}{\mu(x)}\Big( y_0 + \int_{x_0}^x \mu(s)q(s) ds \Big) \Big] \\
					&= -\frac{\mu'(x)}{\mu^2(x)}\Big( y_0 + \int_{x_0}^x \mu(s)q(s) ds \Big) + \frac{1}{\mu(x)} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}\Big( y_0 + \int_{x_0}^x \mu(s)q(s) ds \Big) \\
					&= -\frac{\mu'(x)}{\mu(x)} \cdot \frac{1}{\mu(x)}\Big( y_0 + \int_{x_0}^x \mu(s)q(s) ds \Big) + \frac{\mu(x)q(x)}{\mu(x)} \\
					&= -\frac{p(x)\mu(x)}{\mu(x)}y + q(x) \\
					&= -p(x)y + q(x)

			This form of the solution specifically uses the fact that there is some initial condition. In order to use definite integrals, one of the boundaries has to represent the initial condition, otherwise there is not enough information. So generally when there may not be more information, an indefinite integral is utilized to account for the family of solutions.
