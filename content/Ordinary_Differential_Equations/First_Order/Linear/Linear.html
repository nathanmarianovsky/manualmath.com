	The Setup
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	Given a differential equation in the form:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			y' + p(x)y = q(x)
		}$
	</div>
	where $y'$ denotes the first derivative, under any functions
	$p(x)$ and $q(x)$ the solution can always be obtained.

	Motivating the Need for an Integrating Factor
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	When approaching the differential equation above, it might be a good idea
	if the left side can be rewritten as a product rule. Unfortunately, the given
	equation does not conform to a product rule, but perhaps we can define some factor
	such that:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\mu y' + \mu p(x)y = \frac{d}{dx} (\mu y)
		}$
	</div>
	If this is to hold true, then we must have it such that:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\mu' &= \mu p(x) \\
			\frac{d\mu}{dx} &= \mu p(x) \\
			\frac{d\mu}{\mu} &= p(x) dx \\
			\int \frac{d\mu}{\mu} &= \int p(x) dx \\
			\ln|\mu| &= P(x) + C \\
			\mu &= e^{P(x) + C} \\
			\mu &= e^C e^{P(x)} \\
			\mu &= D e^{P(x)}
		}$
	</div>
	where $P(x)$ denotes the antiderivative of $p(x)$. Towards the end I specifically
	went out of my way to stress how the constant plays out. Notice that there is not one
	definite integrating factor, but rather a whole family of them. So which one do we choose?
	As a human being you want to make your life easier, so just let $D = 1$ and move on. With this
	choice the integrating factor is officially defined as:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\mu = e^{P(x)}
		}$
	</div>
</div>

<div class='latex_section'>
	Solving the Equation
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	With the integrating factor officially defined, solving the differential equation becomes a 
	trivial task:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			y' + p(x)y &= q(x) \\
			\mu y' + \mu p(x)y &= \mu q(x) \\
			\frac{d}{dx} (\mu y) &= \mu q(x) \\
			d(\mu y) &= \mu q(x) dx \\
			\int d(\mu y) &= \int \mu q(x) dx \\
			\mu y &= \int \mu q(x) dx \\
			y &= \frac{1}{\mu} \int \mu q(x) dx
		}$
