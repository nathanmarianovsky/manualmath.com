	The Setup
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Given a differential equation in the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y' + p(x)y = q(x)
		}$
	</div>
	where $y'$ denotes the first derivative, under any functions $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ that are bounded and have only a finite number of discontinuties the solution can always be obtained.

	Motivating the Need for an Integrating Factor
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	When approaching the differential equation above, it might be a good idea if the left side can be rewritten as a product rule. Unfortunately, the given equation does not conform to a product rule, but perhaps we can define some factor such that:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\mu y' + \mu p(x)y = \frac{d}{dx} (\mu y)
		}$
	</div>
	If this is to hold true, then we must have it such that:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\mu' &= \mu p(x) \\
			\frac{d\mu}{dx} &= \mu p(x) \\
			\frac{d\mu}{\mu} &= p(x) dx \\
			\int \frac{d\mu}{\mu} &= \int p(x) dx \\
			\ln|\mu| &= P(x) + C \\
			\mu &= e^{P(x) + C} \\
			\mu &= e^C e^{P(x)} \\
			\mu &= D e^{P(x)}
		}$
	</div>
	where:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			P(x) = \int p(x) dx
		}$
	</div>
	Towards the end I specifically went out of my way to stress how the constant plays out. Notice that there is not one definite integrating factor, but rather a whole family of them. So which one do we choose? As a human being you want to make your life easier, so just let $D = 1$ and move on. With this choice the integrating factor is officially defined as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\mu = e^{P(x)}
		}$
	</div>
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Solving the Equation
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	With the integrating factor officially defined, solving the differential equation becomes a trivial task:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y' + p(x)y &= q(x) \\
			\mu(x) y' + \mu(x) p(x)y &= \mu(x) q(x) \\
			\frac{d}{dx} (\mu(x) y) &= \mu(x) q(x) \\
			d(\mu(x) y) &= \mu(x) q(x) dx \\
			\int d(\mu(x) y) &= \int \mu(x) q(x) dx \\
			\mu(x) y(x) &= \int \mu(x) q(x) dx \\
			y(x) &= \frac{1}{\mu(x)}(L(x) + C)
		}$
	</div>
	where:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			L(x) = \int \mu(x) q(x) dx
		}$
	</div>
	Given an initial condition, the value of $C$ can be determined, otherwise leave this as the general solution.
