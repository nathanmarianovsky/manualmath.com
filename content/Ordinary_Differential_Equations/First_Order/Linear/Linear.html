	The Setup
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	Given a differential equation in the form:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			y' + p(x)y = q(x)
		}$
	</div>
	where $y'$ denotes the first derivative, under any functions
	$p(x)$ and $q(x)$ that are bounded and have only a finite number of discontinuties
	the solution can always be obtained.
</div>

<div class='latex_section'>
	Motivating the Need for an Integrating Factor
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	When approaching the differential equation above, it might be a good idea
	if the left side can be rewritten as a product rule. Unfortunately, the given
	equation does not conform to a product rule, but perhaps we can define some factor
	such that:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\mu y' + \mu p(x)y = \frac{d}{dx} (\mu y)
		}$
	</div>
	If this is to hold true, then we must have it such that:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\mu' &= \mu p(x) \\
			\frac{d\mu}{dx} &= \mu p(x) \\
			\frac{d\mu}{\mu} &= p(x) dx \\
			\int \frac{d\mu}{\mu} &= \int p(x) dx \\
			\ln|\mu| &= P(x) + C \\
			\mu &= e^{P(x) + C} \\
			\mu &= e^C e^{P(x)} \\
			\mu &= D e^{P(x)}
		}$
	</div>
	where $P(x)$ denotes the antiderivative of $p(x)$. Towards the end I specifically
	went out of my way to stress how the constant plays out. Notice that there is not one
	definite integrating factor, but rather a whole family of them. So which one do we choose?
	As a human being you want to make your life easier, so just let $D = 1$ and move on. With this
	choice the integrating factor is officially defined as:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\mu = e^{P(x)}
		}$
	</div>
</div>

<div class='latex_section'>
	Obtaining General Solution First
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	With the integrating factor officially defined, solving the differential equation becomes a 
	trivial task:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			y' + p(x)y &= q(x) \\
			\mu(x) y' + \mu(x) p(x)y &= \mu(x) q(x) \\
			\frac{d}{dx} (\mu(x) y) &= \mu(x) q(x) \\
			d(\mu(x) y) &= \mu(x) q(x) dx \\
			\int d(\mu(x) y) &= \int \mu(x) q(x) dx \\
			\mu(x) y(x) &= \int \mu(x) q(x) dx \\
			y(x) &= \frac{1}{\mu(x)} \int \mu(x) q(x) dx
		}$
	</div>
	The integral on the right hand side will spit out a constant that is usually left in the general solution.
	Given an initial condition, plug in the point to determine the value of the constant for the particular solution.
</div>

<div class='latex_section'>
	Getting the Particular Solution First
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	In the previous calculation I used the indefinite integral and I did so for a reason. You may not always be given
	an initial condition, so the general solution is what is wanted. Even though you can take the general solution with
	some initial value to get the particular solution, lets now use the definite integral to calculate the particular solution
	right off the bat given that $y(x_0) = y_0$:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			y' + p(s)y &= q(s) \\
			\mu(s) y' + \mu(s) p(s)y &= \mu(s) q(s) \\
			\frac{d}{ds} (\mu(s) y) &= \mu(s) q(s) \\
			d(\mu(s) y) &= \mu(s) q(s) ds \\
			\int_{x_0}^x d(\mu(s) y) &= \int_{x_0}^x \mu(s) q(s) ds \\
			(\mu(s) y) \Big|_{x_0}^x &= \int_{x_0}^x \mu(s) q(s) ds \\
			(\mu(x) y(x)) - (\mu(x_0) y(x_0)) &= \int_{x_0}^x \mu(s) q(s) ds \\
			\mu(x) y(x) &= \mu(x_0) y(x_0) + \int_{x_0}^x \mu(s) q(s) ds \\
			y(x) &= \frac{1}{\mu(x)} \Big( \mu(x_0) y(x_0) + \int_{x_0}^x \mu(s) q(s) ds \Big)
		}$
	</div>
	Now lets comment on a few things. I first of all switched the functions in the beginning to have variable $s$ instead of $x$ so that
	I could use $x$ on the bounds of the integrals. Now formally:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\mu(x) = e^{\int_{x_0}^x p(s) ds}
		}$
	</div>
	which implies
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\mu(x_0) = e^{\int_{x_0}^{x_0} p(s) ds} = e^0 = 1
		}$
	</div>
	and allows us to write down the final solution as:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			y(x) = \frac{1}{\mu(x)} \Big( y_0 + \int_{x_0}^x \mu(s) q(s) ds \Big)
		}$
	</div>
	Note that whether using the indefinite or definite integral, the final solution should always come out to be the same as can easily
	be confirmed by close comparison of the final formulas for both methods.
