	The Setup
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Given a differential equation in the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y' = f(x,y)
		}$
	</div>
	where $y'$ denotes the first derivative, an exact solution can be obtained with the use of a substitution
	if the function is homogeneous of order zero.

	Homogeneous Functions

<div class="latex_body">
	Before tackling the differential equation, it is important to understand what homogeneous functions are. Formally
	any function that satisfies:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(tx,ty) = t^n f(x,y)
		}$
	</div>
	is known as a homogeneous function of degree $n$. For the differential equation we are going to need the function
	to be homogeneous of degree zero thus giving the condition:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(tx,ty) = f(x,y)
		}$
	</div>
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Solving the Equation
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Now given that the function on the right hand side of the differential equation from above is homogeneous of 
	degree zero, then make the following substitution:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y &= ux \\
			y' &= u'x + u
		}$
	</div>
	so that the differential equation becomes separable:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y' &= f(x,y) \\
			u'x + u &= f(x,ux) \\
			u'x + u &= f(1,u) \\
			u'x &= f(1,u) - u \\
			\frac{du}{dx}x &= f(1,u) - u \\
			\frac{du}{f(1,u) - u} &= \frac{dx}{x} \\
			\int \frac{du}{f(1,u) - u} &= \int \frac{dx}{x} \\
			W(u) &= \ln|x| + C \\
			W(u) - \ln|x| &= C
		}$
	</div>
	where $W(u)$ denotes the antiderivative of $(f(1,u) - u)^{-1}$. To finish off consider the fact that the original
	equation consisted of $x$'s and $y$'s. So to get back into this form just use the fact that $u = \frac{y}{x}$:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			W\Big( \frac{y}{x} \Big) - \ln|x| = C
		}$
	</div>
	Usually the solution is left in implicit form since the algebra is typically too hard to determine an explicit solution.
