	Given the differential equation:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			M(x,y) dx + N(x,y) dy = 0
		}$
	</div>
	Prove that a homogeneous substitution can be used iff $M(x,y)$ and $N(x,y)$ are both homogeneous of the same degree.

			Proving iff statements requires showing both directions. First reorganizing:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{M(x,y)}{N(x,y)}
				}$
			</div>
			and assuming that the function is homogeneous, it must satisfy:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					f(x,y) &= f(tx,ty) \\
					-\frac{M(x,y)}{N(x,y)} &= -\frac{M(tx,ty)}{N(tx,ty)} \\
					-\frac{M(x,y)}{N(x,y)} &= -\frac{t^\alpha M(x,y)}{t^\beta N(x,y)}
				}$
			</div>
			I have pulled out the $t$'s at the last step since it is the only chance to make the statement true since all the $t$'s must cancel. For this very same reasoning we must have it s.t. $\alpha = \beta$, which states the both components are homogeneous of the same degree. Now assuming that both functions are homogeneous of the same degree looking above it should be clear right away that the general function is going to be homogeneous of degree zero.
