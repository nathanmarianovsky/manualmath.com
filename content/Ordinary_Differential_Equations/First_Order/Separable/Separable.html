	The Setup
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	Given a differential equation in the form:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			y' = f(x,y)
		}$
	</div>
	where $y'$ denotes the first derivative, under certain conditions
	the function becomes separable.
</div>

<div class='latex_section'>
	Separation under Multiplication
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	Assume that the function can be separated under multiplication as:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			f(x,y) = j(x)k(y)
		}$
	</div>
	Plugging this into the differential equation yields:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			y' &= j(x)k(y)
		}$
	</div>
	The next step is to rewrite the derivative in Leibniz's notation and separate the
	differentials so that both sides can be integrated:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{dy}{dx} &= j(x)k(y) \\
			\frac{dy}{k(y)} &= j(x) dx \\
			\int \frac{dy}{k(y)} &= \int j(x) dx \\
			K(y) &= J(x) + C \\
			K(y) - J(x) &= C
		}$
	</div>
	where $K(y)$ and $J(x)$ represent the antiderivatives of $(k(y))^{-1}$ and $j(x)$ respectively.
	The above solution was left in implicit form, but sometimes the solution can be put in explicit form
	if the algebra allows it.
</div>

<div class='latex_section'>
	Separation under Addition
</div>
<div class='latex_body'>
	I now want to show that when talking about separability in relation to first
	order differential equations, separability under addition is never useful to solving
	the equation at hand. To see this first hand assume that the function can be separated under addition as:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			f(x,y) = g(x) + h(y)
		}$
	</div>
	Plugging this into the differential equation and following through like before:
	<div class='latex_equation'>
		$\eqalign{
			y' &= g(x) + h(y) \\
			\frac{dy}{dx} &= g(x) + h(y) \\
			dy &= \Big( g(x) + h(y) \Big) dx
		}$
	</div>
	At that last step is should become apparent that no matter what algebraic manipulation
	you perform, there is no way to put all of the $x$'s and $y$'s on independent sides. So
	whenever someone mentions separable differential equations, it is usually implied that it is
	separability under multiplication.
