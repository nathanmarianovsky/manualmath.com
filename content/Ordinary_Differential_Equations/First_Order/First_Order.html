		First order differential equations are typically the first equations of interest since they are understood extensively when compared to higher orders. Cases of significance typically include separable, linear, exact, and homogeneous equations that have a systematic approach to solving the equations. All of these share the unique feature that they are linear in nature, which is what makes the Bernoulli differential equation rather intriguing in comparison. Even though it is non-linear, it actually has a method to attain the exact solution. Along with these equations, autonomous systems study the special case where the derivative is only a function of the original function. To finish off, Newton's Method provides a numerical algorithm to calculate the function at a point given some initial condition and the derivative. This especially becomes important when no there is no analytical method to solve the differential equation.
