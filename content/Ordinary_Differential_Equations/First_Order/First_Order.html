		The first-order topic deals with different ordinary differential equations that at most have a
		first derivative with different setups. Cases of interest typically include separable, linear, exact,
		and homogeneous differential equations that have a systematic approach to solving the equations. All of
		these share the unique feature that they are linear in nature, which is what makes the Bernoulli differential
		equation rather intriguing. Even though it is non-linear, it actually has a method to attain the exact solution.
		To finish off, the fact that analytic solutions cannot always be found, a numerical algorithm exists known as Newton's
		Method for approximating the solution to a first-order initial value problem.
