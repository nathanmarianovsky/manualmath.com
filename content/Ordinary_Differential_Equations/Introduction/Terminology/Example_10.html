	Write down the differential equation that models a situation where on the graph of $y = \phi(x)$ the slope of the tangent line at a point $P(x,y)$ is the square of the distance from $P(x,y)$ to the origin.

			The slope at any given point is going to be represented by $y' = \phi'(x)$. As for the square of the distance from any point $P(x,y)$ to the origin, this can be written down as:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					d^2 = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
				}$
			</div>
			Now given that the slope is equal to the square of the distance, the differential equation is formally written down as:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					y' = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
				}$
			</div>
