	Given the differential equation:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			e^y y^{(7)} + \sin(x)y^{(2)} = \pi 
		}$
	</div>
	where $y^{(n)}$ denotes the $n$th derivative, what is the order? Is it linear, and if so is it homogeneous?

			Since the highest derivative to appear in the differential equation is the seventh derivative, the order is seven. It is not linear because of the exponential factor, especially worse that it is multiplied by one of the derivatives.
