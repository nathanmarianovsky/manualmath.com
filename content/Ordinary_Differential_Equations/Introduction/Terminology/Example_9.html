	Given the differential equation:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{dy}{dx} = \sqrt{y^2 - 9}
		}$
	</div>
	determine whether there exists a unique solution that goes through the different points:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			&(1,4) \\
			&(5,-3) \\
			&(2,-3) \\
			&(-1,1)
		}$

</div>
<div>
	<input type="button" value="Show Solution" class="show_solution">
	<div class="hidden_div">
		<div class="latex_body">
			In order to have a unique solution we need the derivative to exist at that point. For the first three points listed this holds true. As for the last point the derivative takes on imaginary values which we do not care about when we restrict ourselves to the real numbers, thus a unique solution over the real numbers will not exist.
