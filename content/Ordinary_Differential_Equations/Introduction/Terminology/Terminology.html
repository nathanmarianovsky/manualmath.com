	Definition
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	When discussing differential equations, there exist two main classes: ODEs and PDEs. PDEs, partial differential equations,
	which involve functions of more than a single independent variable are typically harder to approach and so will not be
	discussed further here. Thus, when referencing differential equations here, we are going to be talking about ODEs, ordinary differential equations, which involve only functions of a single variable and any of its derivatives. To be formal, an equation in the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y^{(n)} = F(x,y,y^{(1)},y^{(2)},\dots,y^{(n-1)})
		}$
	</div>
	is known as an $\textit{explicit differential equation}$ where $y^{(n)}$ denotes the $n$th derivative, $x$ is the independent variable,
	and $F$ is some function of the independent variable and all derivatives of $y(x)$ except for the $n$th one. While this formulization
	gives a clear definition, it may not always be possible to solve for $y^{(n)}$ using known analytic methods. Therefore, an $\textit{implicit}$ $\textit{ differential equation}$ is one in the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			0 = F(x,y,y^{(1)},y^{(2)},\dots,y^{(n-1)},y^{(n)})
		}$
	</div>
	where $F$ is now a function of the independent variable and all the derivatives of $y(x)$.
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Order
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	A typical way to characterize a given differential equation is to use its $\textit{order}$ where the order is defined to be the natural number
	corresponding to the highest derivative involved. For example:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y^{(5)} + x^2y^{(4)}y^2 = \sin(x)y^{(3)}
		}$
	</div>
	this differential equation can be said to have order five since the highest derivative involved is the fifth derivative.
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Linear
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	While order definitely gives a good characterization of a differential equation, it does not provide any means of understanding how the differential
	equation is actually structured. A differential equation is said to be $\textit{linear}$ if it can be written in the format:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i(x)y^{(i)} = k(x)
		}$
	</div>
	where $a_i(x)$ are some functions of $x$ strictly attached to some derivative of $y(x)$ and $k(x)$ is a standalone part. If an equation cannot be written in this format, then it is known as a $\textit{non-linear}$ differential equation. For example:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y^{(5)} + x^2y^{(4)}y^2 = \sin(x)y^{(3)}
		}$
	</div>
	is not a linear differential equation since the fourth derivative is multiplied by the original function squared. On the other hand:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			7\sin(x)y^{(4)} + 3\ln|x| = 2y + 3e^xy^{(2)}
		}$
	</div>
	is a linear differential equation. Now using the setup for a linear differential equation, further classifications exist depending on the standalone part.
	If $k(x) = 0$ the linear differential equation is also classified as $\textit{homogeneous}$, otherwise it is $\textit{non-homogeneous}$. 
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	General vs. Particular Solution
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Whenever solving a given differential equation, it will always come to the fact that solutions usually involve constants that cannot be determined unless more information is given. When no more information is available, the $\textit{general solution}$ to a differential equation will model all the possible curves that satisfy the equation up to a constant(s). When an initial condition(s) is given, the problem turns into an IVP, initial value problem, which requires not only solving the differential equation for the general solution, but then using the general solution and the initial condition to get the $\textit{particular solution}$. For example:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y(x) = C \hspace{.3cm} \text{where} \hspace{.3cm} C \in \mathbb{R}
		}$
	</div>
	is the general solution to the differential equation:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y'(x) = 0
		}$
	</div>
	If an initial condition is given that $y(x_0) = y_0$, then plugging in to determine the value of $C$ gives:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y(x) = y_0
		}$
	</div>
	which has now become a particular solution to the differential equation.
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Explicit vs. Implicit Solution
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Whenever discussing functions, there exist two common ways to write them down. An $\textit{explicit function}$ is one that is written in the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y = f(x)
		}$
	</div>
	such that it becomes clear that $x$ is the independent variable and $y$ is the dependent variable which is a function of the independent one. Any solution to a differential equation that can be written in this form is known as an $\textit{explicit solution}$. On the other hand, not all solutions can be written in explicit form. Therefore, an $\textit{implicit function}$ is one that is written as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			F(x,y) = 0
		}$
	</div>
	which allows for an interpretation where neither variable is dependent on the other. If asked which is preferred, there really is no good answer to the question. Some differential equations can always have solutions in explicit form, while other ones are always left in implicit form. So generally speaking, it depends on the scenario which is preferred.

	Interval of Existance
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Typically whenever a solution is found for a given differential equation, it is interesting to see where the solution exists. The domain of the solution is commonly known as the $\textit{interval of existance}$ or $\textit{interval of validity}$. For example given that the solution to some differential equation is given as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y(x) = \frac{1}{x-1}
		}$
	</div>
	then the interval of existance is given as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			(-\infty,1) \cup (1,\infty)
		}$
	</div>
</div>
