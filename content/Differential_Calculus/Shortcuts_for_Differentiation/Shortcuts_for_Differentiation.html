		After having studied the formalities of the derivative, it becomes a little hard to believe that mathematicians would sit around all day and compute the derivative using the limit definition. Mathematicians are lazy and as a result shortcuts were invented to help compute the derivative as quickly as possible. Specifically for polynomials, the power rule is the standard way to determine the derivative. For the multiplication and division of two or more functions, the product and quotient rules handle the differentiation respectively. Finally, the chain rule provides a systematic way of handling the differentiation of compositions of functions.
