	Implicit Differentiation
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Even though $y$ cannot be written as a function of $x$ when dealing with an implicit function, the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ can still be determined. The general approach is to take the derivative of both sides. Consider $y$ to be a second variable and apply all of the standard differentiation rules. The only difference that comes up is when $y$ is differentiated, a $y'$ always has to be attached. At the end we solve for $y'$ by isolating it. As an example take the unit circle:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			x^2 + y^2 = 1
		}$
	</div>
	and differentiate both sides to arrive at:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			2x + 2yy' = 0
		}$
	</div>
	Now solving for $y'$:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			y' = -\frac{x}{y}
		}$
	</div>
</div>

			To understand why the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ can be determined when dealing with an implicit function, I must first show you the chain rule for a multivariable function:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\frac{d}{dt} F(x(t), y(t)) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt} 
				}$
			</div>
			So applying this to our situation we arrive at:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\frac{d}{dx} F(x(x), y(x)) &= \frac{d}{dx} C \\
					\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dx} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dx} &= 0 \\
					\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dx} &= 0 \\
					\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dx} &= -\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} \\
					\frac{dy}{dx} &= -\frac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}} \\
				}$
			</div>
			a consistent formula to determine the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ so long as the denominator is not equal to zero, which happens only if there are no $y$'s present.
