		With an understanding of limits at hand, next up is the derivative. We begin with introduction and properties sections that provide the detailing of the derivative as a tool followed by four systematic rules that simplify the process of finding the derivative for a given function. To finish up there is implicit differentiation which handles the case of implicit functions and logarithmic differentiation which is a common trick that comes in handy for many cases.
