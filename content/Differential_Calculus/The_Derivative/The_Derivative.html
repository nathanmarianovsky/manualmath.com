		Throughout this topic you will encounter an introduction to the derivative which motivates the need for it as a mathematical tool. It all begins with the definition of the derivative using limit techniques accompanied by the interpretations of the derivative. Knowing how tedious it is to evaluate a limit, the shortcut formulas to differentiation provide a basis of rules to quickly determine the derivative for all possible scenarios. To finish off, implicit differentiation provides a method of determining the derivative even when working with an implicit function.
