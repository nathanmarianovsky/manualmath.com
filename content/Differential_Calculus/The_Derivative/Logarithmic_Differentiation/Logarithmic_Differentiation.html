	Logarithmic differentiation is not really a topic on its own, but is definitely worth a quick look. In certain scenarios taking the logarithm before differentiating might make the latter easier. Specifically consider the following fact:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{d}{dx} \ln(f(x)) = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}
		}$
	</div>
	which leads to:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f'(x) &= f(x) \cdot \frac{d}{dx} \ln(f(x))
		}$
	</div>
	So essentially in the case where taking the derivative of the logarithm is easier, this method should be used.
