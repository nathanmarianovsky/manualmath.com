		Differential calculus is usually the first calculus course that any undergraduate will take where the subject typically deals with studying the origin, methods to compute, and applications of the derivative as a mathematical tool. To motivate the need for the derivative consider the setup for the average slope of a function, $f(x)$, at any point, having picked out some initial point $x_0$, we define the slope at $x$ in reference to the starting point to be :
		<div class="latex_equation">
			$\eqalign{
				g(x) = \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0}
			}$
		</div>
		Now while average is fine and all, we commonly want to find the most accurate slope that we can, the $\textit{instantaneous}$ rate of change. This can be achieved if move the starting point or the current point closer to the other. So formally the instantaneous rate of change, or $\textit{derivative}$, is defined as:
		<div class="latex_equation">
			$\eqalign{
				\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \lim_{x \rightarrow x_0} \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0}
			}$
		</div>
		As a specific example, in classical mechanics the velocity, $v(t)$, of an object is defined as the derivative of the displacement, $x(t)$:
		<div class="latex_equation">
			$\eqalign{
				v(t) = \frac{d}{dt} x(t)
			}$
		</div>
		Beyond just physics, the derivative is also commonly used to solve optimization problems, help determine the behavior of a function, and even extends to the study of complex variables.
