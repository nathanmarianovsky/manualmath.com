	Higher-Order Derivative Test
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	So when it comes to determining the behavior of the critical point in relation to its function we have the First and Second Derivative Tests at our disposal and generally speaking most cases can be handled with just those two, but what about the case of when the second derivative equates to zero at the critical point? To tackle this issue I introduce to you the $\textit{Higher-Order Derivative Test}$ which is needed when we have a critical point, $x = c$, s.t.:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f \in C^n(I) \hspace{.3cm} \text{where} \hspace{.3cm} &I \subset \mathbb{R} \hspace{.3cm} \text{and} \hspace{.3cm} n \in \mathbb{N} \\
			f^{(n)}(c) \neq 0 \hspace{.3cm} \text{and} \hspace{.3cm} f^{(k)} = 0& \hspace{.3cm} \text{where} \hspace{.3cm} 1 \leq k \leq n - 1
		}$
	</div>
	The test states the following depending on the scenario:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		<table>
	    	<tr>
		    	<td>$n$</td>
			    <td>Sign of $f^{(n)}(c)$</td>
			    <td>Implication</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>Even</td>
			    <td>$-$</td>
			    <td>$x = c$ is a relative maximum of $f$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>Even</td>
			    <td>$+$</td>
			    <td>$x = c$ is a relative minimum of $f$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>Odd</td>
			    <td>$-$</td>
			    <td>$x = c$ is a strictly decreasing point of inflection of $f$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>Odd</td>
			    <td>$+$</td>
			    <td>$x = c$ is a strictly increasing point of inflection of $f$</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>

	As much as I want to say that the above test is a generalization that could handle all cases, it unfortunately is not. Specifically there are a couple of bad scenarios, the first of which occurs for critical points that have a derivative that does not exist. In another scenario we can have a function that has $n$ derivatives evaluating to zero, but the $n + 1$th derivative not being defined. Lastly it can also happen that all higher order derivatives go to zero. No matter the scenario, the test cannot be used to determine the behavior of the critical point.

			We begin this proof by noting the base case $n = 2$ which provides:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					f \in C^2(I) \hspace{.3cm} \text{where} \hspace{.3cm} f''(c) \neq 0 \hspace{.3cm} \text{and} \hspace{.3cm} f' = 0

			Hopefully you notice that this is exactly the Second Derivative Test which we already know to be true. So now we assume the Higher-Order Test and try to show it holds true for $n + 1$. The situation will take the form:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					f \in C^{n + 1}(I) \hspace{.3cm} \text{where} \hspace{.3cm} &I \subset \mathbb{R} \hspace{.3cm} \text{and} \hspace{.3cm} n \in \mathbb{N} \\
					f^{(n + 1)}(c) \neq 0 \hspace{.3cm} \text{and} \hspace{.3cm} f^{(k)} = 0& \hspace{.3cm} \text{where} \hspace{.3cm} 1 \leq k \leq n
				}$
			</div>
			and if true state the following:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				<table>
			    	<tr>
				    	<td>$n + 1$</td>
					    <td>Sign of $f^{(n + 1)}(c)$</td>
					    <td>Implication</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
				    	<td>Odd</td>
					    <td>$-$</td>
					    <td>$x = c$ is a relative maximum of $f$</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
				    	<td>Odd</td>
					    <td>$+$</td>
					    <td>$x = c$ is a relative minimum of $f$</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
				    	<td>Even</td>
					    <td>$-$</td>
					    <td>$x = c$ is a strictly decreasing point of inflection of $f$</td>
					</tr>

				    	<td>Even</td>
					    <td>$+$</td>
					    <td>$x = c$ is a strictly increasing point of inflection of $f$</td>

			since we expect $n$ and $n + 1$ to basically switch roles. Let us start with the first case where $n + 1$ is odd and the $n + 1$th derivative is negative. By the assumed Higher-Order Derivative Test we state that our critical point is a strictly decreasing point of inflection for $f'$. If this is true, then we must have the second derivative of $f'$ transition from positive to negative. Hence $f'''$ transitions from positive to negative and by the First Derivative Test $x = c$ is a relative maximum for $f''$. We also know that at the critical point $f'' = 0$ which tells us that for some neighborhood around the point $f'' < 0$. Now we use the fact that $f' = 0$ at $x = c$ and its slope is always negative. For this situation to hold true we must have $f'$ pass through the critical point transitioning from positive to negative. Finally by the First Derivative Test we state that this critical point is a relative maximum for $f$.

			Now for the second case where $n + 1$ is odd and the $n + 1$th derivative is positive we state that by the assumed Higher-Order Derivative Test our critical point is a strictly increasing point of inflection for $f'$. If this is true, then we must have the second derivative of $f'$ transition from negative to positive. Hence $f'''$ transitions from negative to positive and by the First Derivative Test $x = c$ is a relative minimum for $f''$. We also know that at the critical point $f'' = 0$ which tells us that for some neighborhood around the point $f'' > 0$. Now we use the fact that $f' = 0$ at $x = c$ and its slope is always positive. For this situation to hold true we must have $f'$ pass through the critical point transitioning from negative to positive. Finally by the First Derivative Test we state that this critical point is a relative minimum for $f$.
			<br><br>
			For the third case where $n + 1$ is even and the $n + 1$th derivative is negative we state that by the assumed Higher-Order Derivative Test our critical point is a relative maximum for $f'$. If this is true, then we must have the first derivative of $f'$ transition from positive to negative by the First Derivative Test. So if $f''$ is transitioning from positive to negative it is a strictly decreasing point of inflection for $f$.
			<br><br>
			Lastly for the case where $n + 1$ is even and the $n + 1$th derivative is positive we state by the assumed Higher-Order Derivative Test we state that our critical point is a relative minimum for $f'$. If this is true, then we must have the first derivative of $f'$ transition from negative to positive by the First Derivative Test. So if $f''$ is transitioning from negative to positive it is a strictly increasing point of inflection for $f$. $\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$

			First lets assume that $n$ is odd and $f^{(n)}(c) < 0$. If the slope of $f^{(n - 1)}$ is strictly negative and $f^{(n - 1)}(c) = 0$, we must have $f^{(n - 1)}$ transition from positive to negative and by the First Derivative Test $x = c$ is a relative maximum for $f^{(n - 2)}$. Next we consider that we have a relative maximum and $f^{(n - 2)}(c) = 0$, then $f^{(n - 2)} < 0$ in a neighborhood around the critical point. So now we apply the process just used for $f^{(n)} < 0$ on $f^{(n - 2)} < 0$. If you keep doing this eventually you will arrive at $f''' < 0$ in a neighborhood around the critical point. Since $f''(c) = 0$ and the slope is strictly negative we must have $f''$ transition from positive to negative and by the First Derivative Test $x = c$ is a relative maximum for $f'$. The important part here is that $f''$ transitions from positive to negative, thus $x = c$ is a strictly decreasing point of inflection.
			<br><br>
			Now lets assume that $n$ is odd and $f^{(n)}(c) > 0$. If the slope of $f^{(n - 1)}$ is strictly positive and $f^{(n - 1)}(c) = 0$, we must have $f^{(n - 1)}$ transition from negative to positive and by the First Derivative Test $x = c$ is a relative minimum for $f^{(n - 2)}$. Next we consider that we have a relative minimum and $f^{(n - 2)}(c) = 0$, then $f^{(n - 2)} > 0$ in a neighborhood around the critical point. So now we apply the process just used for $f^{(n)} > 0$ on $f^{(n - 2)} > 0$. If you keep doing this eventually you will arrive at $f''' > 0$ in a neighborhood around the critical point. Since $f''(c) = 0$ and the slope is strictly positive we must have $f''$ transition from negative to positive and by the First Derivative Test $x = c$ is a relative minimum for $f'$. The important part here is that $f''$ transitions from negative to positive, thus $x = c$ is a strictly increasing point of inflection.
			<br><br>
			Switch it up and now consider the scenario with even $n$ and $f^{(n)}(c) < 0$. If the slope of $f^{(n - 1)}$ is strictly negative and $f^{(n - 1)}(c) = 0$, we must have $f^{(n - 1)}$ transition from positive to negative and by the First Derivative Test $x = c$ is a relative maximum for $f^{(n - 2)}$. Next we consider that we have a relative maximum and $f^{(n - 2)}(c) = 0$, then $f^{(n - 2)} < 0$ in a neighborhood around the critical point. So now we apply the process just used for $f^{(n)} < 0$ on $f^{(n - 2)} < 0$. If you keep doing this eventually you will arrive at $f'' < 0$ in a neighborhood around the critical point. Since $f''(c) = 0$ and the slope is strictly negative we must have $f'$ transition from positive to negative and by the First Derivative Test $x = c$ is a relative maximum for $f$.
			<br><br>
			Finally consider even $n$ and $f^{(n)}(c) > 0$. If the slope of $f^{(n - 1)}$ is strictly positive and $f^{(n - 1)}(c) = 0$, we must have $f^{(n - 1)}$ transition from negative to positive and by the First Derivative Test $x = c$ is a relative minimum for $f^{(n - 2)}$. Next we consider that we have a relative minimum and $f^{(n - 2)}(c) = 0$, then $f^{(n - 2)} > 0$ in a neighborhood around the critical point. So now we apply the process just used for $f^{(n)} > 0$ on $f^{(n - 2)} > 0$. If you keep doing this eventually you will arrive at $f'' > 0$ in a neighborhood around the critical point. Since $f'(c) = 0$ and the slope is strictly positive we must have $f'$ transition from negative to positive and by the First Derivative Test $x = c$ is a relative minimum for $f$.
