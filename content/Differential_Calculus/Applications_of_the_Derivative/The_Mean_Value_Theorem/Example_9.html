			Consider the two points:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					f(-1) &= -4 \\
					f(0) &= 1
				}$
			</div>
			and so by the Intermediate Value Theorem we know that:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\exists \hspace{.1cm} \in [-1,0] \hspace{.3cm} \text{s.t.} \hspace{.3cm} f(c) = 0
				}$
			</div>
			Now to prove that there is exactly one root, we assume that there exist two roots s.t.:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					f(\alpha) = f(\beta) = 0
				}$
			</div>
			If this holds true, then by Rolle's Theorem we have the setup:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					f'(x) &= 0 \\
					6x^2 + 6x + 6 &= 0 \\
					x^2 + x + 1 &= 0 \\
					x &= \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} \\
					x &= \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{3}i}{2}
				}$
			</div>
			Since the setup for Rolle's Theorem does not have an associated value, we have a contradiction to our original assumption. Thus there is exactly one root that is real.
