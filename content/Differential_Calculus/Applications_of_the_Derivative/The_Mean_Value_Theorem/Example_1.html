			First we have to determine that all of the conditions are satisfied. We are dealing with a polynomial which is known to be continuous and differentiable. As for the third condition:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					f(0) &= f(2) \\
					(0)^2 - 2(0) &= (2)^2 - 2(2) \\
					0 &= 0 
				}$
			</div>
			With all of the conditions satisfied by using the setup for Rolle's Theorem:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					f'(x) &= 0 \\
					2x - 2 &= 0 \\
					x &= 1
				}$
