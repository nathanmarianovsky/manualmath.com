	Critical Points
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	A $\textit{critical point}$ of a function is any value that satisfies:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f'(x) = 0 \hspace{.3cm} \text{or} \hspace{.3cm} f'(x) = \text{DNE}
		}$
	</div>
	where there are no restrictions on the amount of critical points that a function may attain.

	A Function's Behavior Due to the First Derivative
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	From the definition of the derivative:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f'(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
		}$
	</div>
	observe what happens under different conditions:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		<table>
	    	<tr>
		    	<td>$\textbf{f'(x)}$</td>
			    <td>$\textbf{h}$</td>
			    <td>Implication</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>$+$</td>
			    <td>$+$</td>
			    <td>$f(x + h) > f(x)$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>$+$</td>
			    <td>$-$</td>
			    <td>$f(x + h) < f(x)$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>$-$</td>
			    <td>$+$</td>
			    <td>$f(x + h) < f(x)$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>$-$</td>
			    <td>$-$</td>
			    <td>$f(x + h) > f(x)$</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>
	So in essense if we are given a derivative that is positive the original function is increasing, and decreasing for negative behavior. To finish off we still have to consider the case where the derivative is exactly zero. So assuming that the derivative is zero on an interval, $I$, and we have a differentiable function, then by the Mean Value Theorem:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\exists \hspace{.1cm} c \in &[x_1,x_2] \hspace{.3cm} \text{s.t.} \hspace{.3cm} f(x_2) - f(x_1) = f'(c)(x_2 - x_1) \\
			& \text{where} \hspace{.3cm} [x_1,x_2] \subseteq I
		}$
	</div>
	Since the derivative is zero on the interval:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(x_2) = f(x_1)
		}$
	</div>
	and since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are two arbitrary points in the interval, this holds true for all values in the interval.
</div>

	Relative Extremas
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	According to Fermat's Theorem, if we want to identify extremas we have to look at the critical points. Not all critical points will produce an extrema, but under certain conditions they do. Specifically the following situations can arise when observing the left and right behaviors of the derivative relative to the critical point:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		<table>
	    	<tr>
		    	<td>$\textbf{f'(x)}$ to the Left</td>
		    	<td>$\textbf{f'(x)}$ to the Right</td>
			    <td>Type of Extrema</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>$+$</td>
		    	<td>$+$</td>
			    <td>None</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>$+$</td>
		    	<td>$-$</td>
			    <td>Maximum</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>$-$</td>
		    	<td>$+$</td>
			    <td>Minimum</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>$-$</td>
		    	<td>$-$</td>
			    <td>None</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>
	In other words, a local maximum or minimum will occur iff there is a switch in sign for the derivative. This system of identifying the type of extrema is known as the $\textit{First Derivative Test}$.
