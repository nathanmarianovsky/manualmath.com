	Optimization references the process of determining absolute maximums or minimums of a function given some constraint. Typically our objective function will take the form:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(x,z) = y
		}$
	</div>
	where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all variables. Occasionally we will want to determine the extremas of $y$ so we have the constraint function:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			g(x,z) = L
		}$
	</div>
	where $L$ is a constant. For problems of an undergraduate course the constraint function will be able to produce an explicit function:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			g(x,z) = L \rightarrow z = h(x)
		}$
	</div>
	With this $z$ can be replaced in the objective function s.t.:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(x,h(x)) = y
		}$
	</div>
	Now we recongnize that the original scenario has been reduced into a problem of determining the absolute extremas of the above single variable function. We also have both Derivative Tests at our disposal to determine the type of extrema.
