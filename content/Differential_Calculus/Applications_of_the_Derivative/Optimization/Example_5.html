			First identify the objective function:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					f(r,h) = 2\pi rh + 2\pi r^2
				}$
			</div>
			and the constraint function:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\pi r^2h = 1500 \hspace{.3cm} \text{where} \hspace{.3cm} 0 \leq r \leq \infty
				}$
			</div>
			Now the objective function can be rewritten as:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					k(r) &= f\Big( r, \frac{1500}{\pi r^2} \Big) \\
					&= \frac{3000}{r} + 2\pi r^2
				}$
			</div>
			Differentiation gives:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					k'(r) &= -\frac{3000}{r^2} + 4\pi r
				}$
			</div>
			where the critical points are:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\require{cancel}
					0 &= -\frac{3000}{r^2} + 4\pi r \\
					0 &= -3000 + 4\pi r^3 \\
					r &= \Big( \frac{750}{\pi} \Big)^{\frac{1}{3}}
				}$
			</div>
			Notice that to the left of the point the derivative is negative and positive afterwards. Therefore, by the First Derivative Test we can state this is a relative minimum. Since the boundaries are not included in this case, this is the only minimum, thus it is also the absolute minimum. With this we can state the minimum amount of material that can be achieved is $\approx 725.3964$ $\text{cm}^2$ given a height of $\approx 12.4070$ $\text{cm}$ and base radius of $\approx 6.2035$ $\text{cm}$.
