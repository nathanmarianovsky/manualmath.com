<div class="latex_body">
	Given a function, $f \in C^{1}$, we have:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f'(a) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}
		}$
	</div>
	Now assuming that $h$ is very small we can approximate the derivative as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f'(a) \approx \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}
		}$
	</div>
	and with a little reorganization:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f'(a)h &\approx f(a + h) - f(a) \\
			f(a + h) &\approx f(a) + f'(a)h
		}$
	</div>
	we arrive at what is known as the linear approximation for a given function near $a$. By letting $h = x - a$ the above becomes:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(x) &\approx f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)
		}$
	</div>
	which is equivalent to the first form.
