		After having learned what the derivative is, its associated properties, and how it is computed, we finally move towards its applications. The first four sections deal with the physical implications of the derivative in relation to the original function's extremas and concavity behavior. Next up related rates and optimization present real world applications of implicit differentiation and function extremas respectively. To finish up linear approximation presents how a function can be estimated when observing locally, L'Hospital's Rule presents a systematic technique to evaluating limits that approach indeterminate forms, and Newton's method presents a numerical algorithm to determine the root of a function on a given interval.
