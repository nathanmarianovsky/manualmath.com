<div class="latex_body">
	By now it is known that a function can be approximated as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(x) \approx f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0)
		}$
	</div>
	where $x_0$ is the point we choose to center ourselves at. Now what if we wanted to find the root of the function given some interval $[a,b]$? To accomplish this we set the function equal to zero and solve for $x$:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			0 &\approx f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0) \\
			0 &\approx f(x_0) + f'(x_0)x - f'(x_0)x_0 \\
			f'(x_0)x &\approx f'(x_0)x_0 - f(x_0) \\
			x &\approx x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}
		}$
	</div>
	where the result is exactly what we want, but when working with machines we typically like to use recursive algorithms so by discretization:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			x_{n + 1} \approx x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
		}$
	</div>
	The result is known as $\textit{Newton's Method}$, which is one of the most widely known numerical algorithms used to determine the roots of a function.
