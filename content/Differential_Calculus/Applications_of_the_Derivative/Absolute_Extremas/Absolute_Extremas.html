		$\eqalign{
			f(x) \hspace{.3cm} \text{where} \hspace{.3cm} x \in [a,b] \hspace{.3cm} \text{and} \hspace{.3cm} f'(x) \hspace{.3cm} \text{exists on} \hspace{.3cm} (a,b)

	we want to determine the function's $\textit{absolute maximum and minimum}$ on the interval. In essense given a bounded interval we want to determine the values of $x$ s.t. the function is at its greatest and lowest. Due to the Extreme Value Theorem we know that these $x$ values do exist in the given domain, so now we have to construct a methodology to determine the values. To start we know from Fermat's Theorem that any extremum is identified by a critical point, but this only applies to the interior. So to take into account the boundary we have to manually check those points, thereby giving the general strategy:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		<table>
	    	<tr>
		    	<td>Step</td>
			    <td>Instructions</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>1</td>
			    <td>Determine all of the critical points in the region $(a,b)$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>2</td>
			    <td>Evaluate the original function at each of the critical points and $x = a, b$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		    	<td>3</td>
			    <td>Compare all of the values from Step 2 and identify the biggest one as the absolute maximum and vice versa for the absolute minimum</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>
	The benefit of this approach is that we do not have to use either of the derivative tests to identify the critical points since it does not interest us, thus really making this a process of determining all of the necessary values and comparing the evaluations. Also note that in some context the terminology global is used in place of absolute, but I will purely stick to absolute.
