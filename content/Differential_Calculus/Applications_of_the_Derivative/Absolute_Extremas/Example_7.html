	A square sheet of tin $a$ inches on a side is to be used to make an open-top box by cutting a small square of tin from each corner and bending up the sides. How large a square should be cut from each corner in order that the box shall have as large a volume as possible?

			On the square bottom we shall end up with sides of length:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					l = a - 2x
				}$
			</div>
			since $x$ is taken away from each side. As for the height it will exactly correspond to:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					h = x
				}$
			</div>
			because it represents the width of the piece that gets bend upwards. Now we define the volume as:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					V &= l^2h \\
					&= x(a - 2x)^2
				}$
			</div>
			and to determine the extrema we need the first derivative:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					V' = (a - 2x)^2 - 4x(a - 2x)
				}$
			</div>
			Equating to zero will provide us the critical points:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					0 &= (a - 2x)^2 - 4x(a - 2x) \\
					0 &= (a - 2x)((a - 2x) - 4x) \\
					0 &= (a - 2x)(a - 6x) \\
					x &= \frac{a}{6}, \frac{a}{2}
				}$
			</div>
			Now using the fact that $x \in \Big[ 0, \frac{a}{2} \Big]$:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					V\Big( 0 \Big) &= 0 \\
					V\Big( \frac{a}{6} \Big) &= \frac{2a}{27} \\
					V\Big( \frac{a}{2} \Big) &= 0
				}$
			</div>
			With this we can state that in order to form the largest possible volume the optimal choice is $x = \frac{a}{6}$.
