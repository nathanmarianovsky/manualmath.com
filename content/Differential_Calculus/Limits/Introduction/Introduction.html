	Definition
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	The $\textit{limit}$ of a function, $f(x)$, as $x \rightarrow a$ is written as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L
		}$
	</div>
	where $L$ is some real number. A limit in essense is the process of determining what value $f(x)$ approaches as we look near $a$. Note that during this process we have to consider that the image at hand is a one dimensional line for $x$ and so there are two directions in which we can approach $a$, left and right. As a consequence we say that a limit will only exist if it is the same value being approached from both sides.
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Graphical Approach
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	One of the standard approaches to evaluating limits is a graphical one. Take for example the following graph of a piecewise function:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		<img src="/content/Differential_Calculus/Limits/Introduction/Example_Function.gif">
	</div>
	Lets say that we want to determine what the limit of the function is as $x \rightarrow 1$. To do this look at the graph and observe that as $x$ approaches $1$ from both the left side and right side, the function approaches $1$. So formally:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\lim_{x \rightarrow 1} f(x) = 1
		}$
	</div>
	Notice that even though the limit says the function approaches $1$, in reality $f(1) = 2$. So in general the function evaluated at a point and the limit at the point do not have to equate. As another example consider the scenario where $x \rightarrow 2$, what is the limit of the function now? As we approach from the left side we get a value of $2$, but from the right side we get $3$. So formally:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\lim_{x \rightarrow 2} f(x) = \text{DNE}
		}$
	</div>
	since the two sides do not approach the same value. 
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Numerical Approach
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Another standard method to evaluate limits is to use a numerical approach. Essentially the goal is to check the pattern of the function near the point of interest by directly calculating the function. For example consider the function:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x + 1}
		}$
	</div>
	You should be able to note that the function has a vertical asymptote at $x = -1$, but what is the limit as $x \rightarrow -1$? To do this numerically, just create a table of values and observe the patten from both sides:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		<table>
			<tr>
			    <td>$\textbf{x}$</td>
			    <td>$\textbf{f(x)}$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>$-1.100$</td>
			    <td>$-2.100$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>$-1.010$</td>
			    <td>$-2.010$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>$-1.001$</td>
			    <td>$-2.001$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>$-0.999$</td>
			    <td>$-1.999$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>$-0.990$</td>
			    <td>$-1.990$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>$-0.900$</td>
			    <td>$-1.900$</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>
	Hopefully you notice from the table that as $x \rightarrow -1$, the function approaches $-2$. So formally:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\lim_{x \rightarrow -1} f(x) = -2
		}$
	</div>
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Analytical Approach
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	Besides the graphical approach which involves just looking at a graph to determine the limit and the numerical approach which is nothing more than a brute force method to determine the limit, there also exists the analytical approach to evaluating a limit. This approach involves nothing more than using some mathematical intuition to evaluate the limit. For example consider the same function as before:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x + 1}
		}$
	</div>
	which officially has a vertical asymptote at $x = -1$. To evaluate the limit directly:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\lim_{x \rightarrow -1} f(x) &= \lim_{x \rightarrow -1} \frac{x^2 - 1}{x + 1} \\
			&= \lim_{x \rightarrow -1} \frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x + 1} \\
			&= \lim_{x \rightarrow -1} (x - 1) \\
			&= -2
		}$
	</div>
	which happens to work since the vertical asymptote is a removable singularity. Yet, this brings up an interesting point when evaluating the second to last line. Why is it that I am allowed to just plug in the value of $x = -1$ to evaluate the limit? It so happens that in general if we have a known continuous function, $g(x)$, we are allowed to say that:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x) = g(a)
		}$
	</div>
	Besides the removable singularity, another common trick involves using the conjugate. For example consider the function:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			k(x) = \frac{x - 1}{\sqrt{x} - 1}
		}$
	</div>
	where the limit as $x \rightarrow 1$ is:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\lim_{x \rightarrow 1} k(x) &= \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{x - 1}{\sqrt{x} - 1} \\
			&= \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{x - 1}{\sqrt{x} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{x} + 1}{\sqrt{x} + 1} \\
			&= \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{(x - 1)(\sqrt{x} + 1)}{x - 1} \\
			&= \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} (\sqrt{x} + 1) \\
			&= 2
		}$
	</div>
</div>

<div class="latex_section">
	Indeterminate Forms
</div>
<div class="latex_body">
	When dealing with limits, something that you may typically run across are $\textit{indeterminate forms}$, which are expressions that do not hold any numerical expression since they approach different values under certain conditions. In the context of literature, some common examples of indetermine forms include, but are not limited to:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\frac{0}{0}, \frac{\infty}{\infty}, 0 \times \infty, \infty - \infty, 0^0, 1^\infty, \hspace{.1cm} \text{and} \hspace{.1cm} \infty^0
		}$
	</div>
	If a limit does take on one of these values, it does not guarantee that the limit does not exist, but rather it implies that more work will have to be performed to figure out the limit.
