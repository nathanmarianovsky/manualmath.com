<div class="latex_body">
	In the context of Special Relativity, the $\textit{Lorentz Factor}$ is defined as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\gamma(v) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
		}$
	</div>
	where $c$ is the speed of light. The theory of relativity states that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, therefore, only the left side as $v \rightarrow c$ interests us. Evaluate:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			\lim_{v \rightarrow c^-} \gamma(v)
		}$
	</div>
	If you are told that momentum in Classical Mechanics is defined as:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			p_{\text{CM}}(v) = mv
		}$
	</div>
	where $m$ is the mass of the object and in Special Relativity:
	<div class="latex_equation">
		$\eqalign{
			p_{\text{SR}}(v) = \gamma(v)mv
		}$
	</div>
	what happens to momentum in Special Relativity that does not seem to occur in Classical Mechanics?

			which provides evidence to state that:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\lim_{v \rightarrow c^-} \gamma(v) = \infty
				}$
			</div>
			In Classical Mechanics the notion of the speed of light was never a part of the theory, thereby providing that:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\lim_{v \rightarrow c^-} p_{\text{CM}}(v) = mc
				}$
			</div>
			momentum is clearly defined. Experimentally this was found not to hold true, but rather what happens is that near the speed of light the momentum skyrockets so much that it becomes infinite when traveling at the speed of the light for an object with mass:
			<div class="latex_equation">
				$\eqalign{
					\lim_{v \rightarrow c^-} p_{\text{SR}}(v) = \infty
				}$
			</div>
