		Prior to tackling the derivative, it is important to first understand what limits are. It all begins with an introduction that explains what limits are, their purpose, and their one-sided counterparts. Once a fundamental comprehension of limits has been grasped, we move on to study properties of limits, limits that deal with infinity, and the application of limits towards the definition of continuity. In the last section I present to you the formal definition of a limit and its properties from an analytical perspective.
