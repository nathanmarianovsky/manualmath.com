		Prior to tackling the derivative, it is important to first understand what limits are. Starting with an introduction that explains what limits are and their purpose, we continue to analyze one-sided limits, properties of limits, limits dealing with infinity, and the application of limits towards the definition of continuity. The last section covers the definition of a limit and its properties from an analysis perspective.
